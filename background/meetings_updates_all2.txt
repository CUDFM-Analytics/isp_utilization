re: 1 ) already have
re: 2 ) change to relative to 2020
re: 3 & 4 ) telehealth > pcmp's delivering it > get from Carter
		    doesn't matter WHO MEMBER IS: if attrib to that , then calc; really looking for any tlh claim for that pcmp
			clm_line probably line file or clm_dimension
			not worry about n_tlh visits per month - just if they ARE / AREN'T 
			hopefully it's in the header file bc that's pcmp  
			pcmp-level measures  
			
re: 5 ) now looking at members attributed BY QUARTER 
		need to assign member to unique pcmp per quarter 
		kind of like line 1 but calculate quarters (not monthly)
		assign to the latest one if >1
		
Quarterly but PMPM average for any months eligible in that quarter: 
	if only 1 month/q, use that number
	if >=2, average the PMPM Total FFS
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Carter: see var sources
use COUNTY var from LONGITUDINAL > not other one
qry_monthly_utilization > one row pmpm > take longit., subset months with eligibility, join to util & take rows that match

Email from Carter

	The two files are in place: qry_longitudinal, qry_demographics
	The only change I made to the structure was to rename clnt_ID to mcaid_ID to agree with the rest of the BIDM tables.
	There were a few bumps in the process, so I will do some extra QC this weekend just in case, but these should be good to go.
	Have a great weekend!

I requested another meeting with CS because he wrote in the tables to not use subset clnt_dim anymore, and that's what we'd agreed on in our last meeting
I asked how to go about the template flow: 
- He said those are no longer needed, he added back into the document var_source_... the old datasets (medicaidlong, meddemog)
- Then said he would add those to subset folder. 

Discussed copying the sets onto C computer/ SAS 'doesn't use RAM'? not sure.

Dec 01, 2022
Meeting with Carter: 
- He told me if I didn't mind re-doing the code, to switch to 'subset analytics'
- I re-did the code, asked him to review the template steps becuase I didn't see how they aligned now

Topics		: clustering, attribution, time units, estimation technique, risk adjustment
Files		: Analysis_Specifications.xlsx

Notes		

Dealing with Clustering: 
- Carter's macro: 
	doesn't adjust for clustering within practice
	uses genmod, which only allows one random effect / idea more of a population approach  
- Discussed potentially using practice / clinic as fixed effect rather than random since it's a closed / complete group
- wouldn't impact standard errors as the random effect would
- could bootstrap clinics
- wouldn't think of it as a random effect if I didn't have to... 
- if bootstrapping: would do it as 1:1 or proportionate to practice size? 
- if you sample on clinic vs patient & keep clinic as fixed effect, not all clinics would be represented, but model would be more stable (as would include all pts within that prac) 
- since we're not interested in clinic fixed effects it's okay that we wouldn't be using all clinics (if bootstrapping etc)
- INFERENCE more directed at predicted effect / practices / population of patients in ISP vs non-ISP anyways...
- Discussed if bootstrapping do you use bootstrap mean or observed mean / same with SD...
- Carter usually uses observed mean in bootstrapping 
- Pivoted to jacknife: would have half the the iterations > would lose sampling dn but if you don't need it, that's fine

Decisions: 
- Jacknife technique for resampling at clinic level (clinic as fixed effect)
- time unit: quarter
- model is quarter nested within person, person nested within clinic
- 'resampling at the top of that nesting should be okay...' 

RISK ADJUSTMENT:
- risk adjustment to put in for each person: adults (18+) use Charlson Comorbidity Index, peds use PMCA 
	Jake has code for CCI, CS has code for PMCA
	1: flag adult or peds
	2: one composite variable: high, medium, or low complexity
	3: in

ISP Utilization Notes  
 - Data specs tab: everyone 0-64 in that state fiscal year (& only that FY - not 1920 if they turned 65 in 19-20)   
 - Step one will be identifying the targpop, then step 2 is pulling claims from 2015+    
 - Question of Interest will be how we define 'attributed' for the model, but for now it's anyone with 1 month in medlong  
 - ISP PCMPs vs non-ISP PCMPs  
 - Carter has definitions of what we consider 'primary care'  
 - given that ISP had this telehealth focus, we want to do that as well  
	- place of service
	- FQ's is a modifier for procedure codes
 - row 14: not quite sure how we'll operationalize that yet  
 - Carter has code for:  
	- hospitalizations  
	- pharmacy  
	- BH  
 - Jake has budget groups / rules we've been using
