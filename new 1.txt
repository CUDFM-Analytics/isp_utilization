Hi Tristen!!

I really appreciate you and your leadership! I’m a big fan 😊

I hesitate to comment on the doc too much out of respect for your response to my question about definitions on the call when we reviewed them. I understand not wanting to get too in the weeds about making sure teams are using the same definitions, but I think operationalizing terms specifically would clarify aspects where I’m unsure what it means (eg: “Invited NOT Connected” definition says, “consented patient not connected to the study or VIRcis account” - I wouldn’t know how to determine ‘Invited’ vs ‘Consented’ in this context, know what I mean?). 

I definitely want to honor Sabrina’s hard work on it too, and I don’t know what she was tasked with or how, either, so that’s a huge component.

I still feel it’s worthwhile and important to standardize some of these terms – but that does not mean I’m convinced that I’m correct! I’m sincerely comfortable having a different opinion and holding the notion that mine might be wrong (for lack of a better word…)

As the document stands, I would still have a lot more questions if I were tasked with replicating any values or frequencies from it. But that’s kind of how my mind works – like how would I get that number, too, and where did it come from. But if it works for what you need it to, then I defer to you 100%. 

What would you think if I shared my terminology document with you, and we could consider using it as a template for cgm projects? We’d obviously adapt it as we go, but it’d be like a parent guide for the codebook. Since so many variables in the codebook interact, we could list the interactions and variables, and then maintain it as we continue. 
I have a document I keep for all the reports I’ve done with each term and REDCap variable qualifiers (and if it differs from one report/project to another), and I think using something like that as a team for umbrella terms like “Active”, “Dropped”, “Finished”, etc. (or whichever term) would be an asset. 

I asked Ashley a lot of questions about the doc today, too.
