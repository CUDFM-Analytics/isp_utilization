Notes		

Dealing with Clustering: 
- Carter's macro: 
	doesn't adjust for clustering within practice
	uses genmod, which only allows one random effect / idea more of a population approach  
- Discussed potentially using practice / clinic as fixed effect rather than random since it's a closed / complete group
- wouldn't impact standard errors as the random effect would
- could bootstrap clinics
- wouldn't think of it as a random effect if I didn't have to... 
- if bootstrapping: would do it as 1:1 or proportionate to practice size? 
- if you sample on clinic vs patient & keep clinic as fixed effect, not all clinics would be represented, but model would be more stable (as would include all pts within that prac) 
- since we're not interested in clinic fixed effects it's okay that we wouldn't be using all clinics (if bootstrapping etc)
- INFERENCE more directed at predicted effect / practices / population of patients in ISP vs non-ISP anyways...
- Discussed if bootstrapping do you use bootstrap mean or observed mean / same with SD...
- Carter usually uses observed mean in bootstrapping 
- Pivoted to jacknife: would have half the the iterations > would lose sampling dn but if you don't need it, that's fine

Decisions: 
- Jacknife technique for resampling at clinic level (clinic as fixed effect)
- time unit: quarter
- model is quarter nested within person, person nested within clinic
- 'resampling at the top of that nesting should be okay...' 

RISK ADJUSTMENT:
- risk adjustment to put in for each person: adults (18+) use Charlson Comorbidity Index, peds use PMCA 
	Jake has code for CCI, CS has code for PMCA
	1: flag adult or peds
	2: one composite variable: high, medium, or low complexity
	3: in

ISP Utilization Notes  
 - Data specs tab: everyone 0-64 in that state fiscal year (& only that FY - not 1920 if they turned 65 in 19-20)   
 - Step one will be identifying the targpop, then step 2 is pulling claims from 2015+    
 - Question of Interest will be how we define 'attributed' for the model, but for now it's anyone with 1 month in medlong  
 - ISP PCMPs vs non-ISP PCMPs  
 - Carter has definitions of what we consider 'primary care'  
 - given that ISP had this telehealth focus, we want to do that as well  
	- place of service
	- FQ's is a modifier for procedure codes
 - row 14: not quite sure how we'll operationalize that yet  
 - Carter has code for:  
	- hospitalizations  
	- pharmacy  
	- BH  
 - Jake has budget groups / rules we've been using
