## ISP Utilization Notes  

 - Data specs tab: everyone 0-64 in that state fiscal year (& only that FY - not 1920 if they turned 65 in 19-20)   
 - Step one will be identifying the targpop, then step 2 is pulling claims from 2015+    
 - Question of Interest will be how we define 'attributed' for the model, but for now it's anyone with 1 month in medlong  
 - ISP PCMPs vs non-ISP PCMPs  
 - Carter has definitions of what we consider 'primary care'  
 - given that ISP had this telehealth focus, we want to do that as well  
	- place of service
	- FQ's is a modifier for procedure codes
 - row 14: not quite sure how we'll operationalize that yet  
 - Carter has code for:  
	- hospitalizations  
	- pharmacy  
	- BH  
 - Jake has budget groups / rules we've been using  
 
 ## CTLP  
 
  - yellow section needs to be updated  
  - CU Med practices  
  - CU Med adds a 9000 in front of each pcmp  
  - AF Williams, Lowry are the two sites  
  - row 2 is ORG - so should not have any attributed, is only used for billing (420085)  
  - 164606 however SHOULD have attributed members, even though they never bill (billing is 420085)  
  - rows 3-14 check for pcmp just using medicaid long file > do asap (KW said today)  
  - Sara interested in well-child checks and how many preventative health checks: MG not sure how important that is for this analysis but keep in mind
