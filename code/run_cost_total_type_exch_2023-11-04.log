NOTE: Class levels for some variables were not printed due to excessive size.
NOTE: PROC GENMOD is modeling the probability that ind_cost_total='1'. One way to change this to 
      model the probability that ind_cost_total='0' is to specify the DESCENDING option in the PROC 
      statement.
NOTE: The GENMOD procedure deleted the model item store OUT.COST_TOTAL_PMODEL_EXCH because of 
      incomplete information for a subsequent analysis.
WARNING: The data set WORK.PREDOUT may be incomplete.  When this step was stopped there were 0 
         observations and 41 variables.

500  VERSION  : 2023-08-24
501           : 2023-08-17 INT_IMP: changed var of interest to int_imp per meeting
502  OUTPUT   : pdf & log file
503  LOG      : Changed data.analysis_final to data.analysis (moved the original data.analysis to
503! int.analysis3, then renamed _final)
504  RELATIONSHIPS : see include statements
505  Per Mark : Use mode for ref class vars budget_group & race if possible
506              - default for budget_grp_num_r is the mode
507              - race = I didn't want to tempt fate so just let it choose since it ran w/ default
