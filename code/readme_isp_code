2023-03-22 WORKING NOTES / CHECK LATER 
****************************************************************************
through row 247 --> ran a8, a9 ; 

row 218 trying data.a8 on int.qrylong_1621_time on mcaid_id and time to see if I get demo: 
G010 mcaid is rae_id = 0 for that q???


file: util_03_...

CHECKS / crosstabs : 

Issues came up with the following values for mcaid_id's: 

  - Y591173 (why?)
  - G002318 
  - G010516 on data.a8 demographic info didn't come in for time = 4 - demo data in int.qrylong_1921 only had time 1:3 for this person, which does NOT make sense...
  - A000405 has BH but not mcaid, I think? Was that the issue? 
  - L155867 - check months of intervention * imp was a good check 
  - 0748682
  - P861018 - months, intervention * implementation 
  - A001791, A003524, A000405, A003219 > two were there, two should have been missing (1618 longitudinal) 
  - G6438649
  - A023159 A020536 A027267
  
PCMP LOC ID 
Check 103320 alternating months int*imp
