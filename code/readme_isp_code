Two members had blanks in their adj: columns (why only 2?) (G657131 and N039812) (is that a 0 or O make sure) 
SAVED LOG in _logs/log_20230330_fix_elig1618.log  

  1. HAVE COST?
	Checked utilization dataset (int.util_1620) and neither were in there so had no costs / visits  
	(util_02_get_prep_ana_util.sas file, rows 42 around there - I had created member eligibility file and it got lost
	when SAS terminated unexpectedly, so couldn't find how I created it again but it had the exact right N so I think I created it right) 
	
  ELIGIBLE? 	
  2. checked ana.qry_longitudinal to see if they were eligible for those years (used scratch file so here's code):   
    
			proc print data = ana.qry_longitudinal ; 
			where mcaid_id in ("G657131" "N039812")
			AND   month ge '01JUL2016'd
			AND   month le '30JUN2019'd; 
			RUN ; 
	
	G657131 had records for 2016, 2017, 2018 (so all FY's at least one month) BUT was rae_assign = 0 for all except 2018 (rae_assign = 1) 
	N039812 had records for       2017, 2018 FY only (not eligible for 2016) and rae_assign for at least one month in each so should be there  
	
  3. Checked int.memlist and int.memlist_attr_qrtr_1921 and they were noth on there for the relevant quarters it looked like... 
	
  4. Just started over with eligibility to test it --> util_02_get_prep_ana_util, start row 137
	 4a. elig1618_memlist0
		  Get records from qry_longitudinal where months filtered 16-19 and pcmp_loc_id ne ' ' to start 
			**** ---- NOT rae_assign!! DUDE learn your lesson *** 
		  Also created 'ind' so you can make a dummy var when transposing years
		  [30167936 obs 5 var] (created FY for compound primary key)  
	 4b. rows 148:150 elig1618_memlist1 
		 Reduced to unique on compound primary key {mcaid_id, FY} 
		 [3169382 : 3]
	 4c. rows 155:160 elig1618_memlist 
		 get members that exist in memlist only (that has budget group, age subsetting) 
		 [2534025 : 3]
	 4d. check all again in the analysis dataset

CHECKS / crosstabs : 

Issues came up with the following values for mcaid_id's: 

  - Y591173 (why?)
  - G002318 
  - G010516 on data.a8 demographic info didn't come in for time = 4 - demo data in int.qrylong_1921 only had time 1:3 for this person, which does NOT make sense...
  - A000405 has BH but not mcaid, I think? Was that the issue? 
  - L155867 - check months of intervention * imp was a good check 
  - 0748682
  - P861018 - months, intervention * implementation 
  - A001791, A003524, A000405, A003219 > two were there, two should have been missing (1618 longitudinal) 
  - G6438649
  - A023159 A020536 A027267
  
PCMP LOC ID 
Check 103320 alternating months int*imp

- crosstabs, simple summary / run analysis file 
- cost: univariates
- cats: freq's 
counts freqs

- outcome measure summary by intervention*implementation 

top code after dividing by months 

run logit on zero/non-zero costs, then do gamma on the positives
